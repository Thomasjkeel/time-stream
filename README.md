# TODO
* Write seperate module for intergrating RainfallQC check e.g. to open up tf.resolution
* ...and also to allow for int type flags to be returned instead of bool expr

# Time-Stream
**Time** **S**eries **T**oolkit for **R**apid **E**nvironmental **A**nalysis and **M**onitoring: A Python library
for handling and analysing timeseries data with a focus on maintaining the integrity of the temporal properties of the
data.

## Overview

Time-Stream provides robust tools for working with timeseries data, built on top of [Polars](https://pola.rs/),
with special attention to:

- Precise temporal handling with Period-based time manipulations
- Smart temporal aggregation
- Provision of a flexible flagging system
- Column relationships for organising complex timeseries datasets

Please make sure your code passes all tests and follows the coding style before submitting a PR.
See **developer setup** below for more information.

## Developer Setup

This is for active development on the time-stream package itself.

### Requirements

#### Install uv

[Official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NERC-CEH/time-stream.git
cd time-stream
```

### Setting up and activating a virtual environment

```commandline
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Linting
Linting uses ruff using the config in pyproject.toml
```
ruff check --fix
```

### Formatting
Formating uses ruff using the config in pyproject.toml which follows the default black settings.
```
ruff format .
```

### Testing
Testing is done using pytest and tests are in the /tests directory.
```
pytest
```

### Pre commit hooks
Run below to setup the pre-commit hooks.
```
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```
This will set this repo up to use the git hooks in the `.githooks/` directory.
The hook runs `ruff format --check` and `ruff check` to prevent commits that are not formatted correctly or have errors.
The hook intentionally does not alter the files, but informs the user which command to run.

## Installing time-stream

Whilst time-stream is under active development, to use time-stream within your project you can do one of two things:

1. Clone the time-stream repository to a location next to your project's repository. Then, you can install time-series using a relative path.

    When you install a package in editable mode, any changes to the source code are immediately
    available to any projects using the package.

    **Using uv directly**
    ```commandline
    uv add --editable /path/to/time-stream
    ```

    **In your project's pyproject.toml**
    ```toml
    [project]
    dependencies = [
        "time-stream"
    ]
    [tool.uv.sources]
    time-stream = { path = "/path/to/time-stream", editable = true }
    ```

    Now when changes have been made to time-stream, you can just do a `git pull` in your cloned directory to get the
    changes, and they will be automatically available in your package.

2. Use the time-stream git url

    **Using uv directly**
    ```commandline
    uv add git+https://github.com/NERC-CEH/time-stream.git
    ```

    **In your project's pyproject.toml**
    ```toml
    [project]
    dependencies = [
        "time-stream"
    ]
    [tool.uv.sources]
    time-stream = { git = "https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" }
    ```
